## About

This example applies functional programming to a non-trivial example, to demonstrate how function composition can yield highly readable and reusable code.

A series of functions are defined to process an input string and format it according to various case styles:

- Lowercase
- Uppercase
- Vowels up
- Consonants up
- Snake case
- Kebab case
- Title case
- Pascal case
- Camel case

The example is discussed in a [post](https://medium.com/@ycandau/composing-functions-in-javascript-373594908b74) on medium.
