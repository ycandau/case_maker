## About

This is an example of a functional approach to processing an input string according to various case styles:

- Lowercase
- Uppercase
- Vowels up
- Consonants up
- Snake case
- Kebab case
- Title case
- Pascal case
- Camel case

The goal is to demonstrate how function composition can yield highly readable and reusable code. The example is discussed in a [post](https://medium.com/@ycandau/composing-functions-in-javascript-373594908b74) on a medium.
